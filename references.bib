	abstract = {We present a probabilistic method for classifying chest computed tomography (CT) scans into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. To this end, we design and train, in an unsupervised manner, a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) on a selected training data set, which is composed only of COVID-19 CT scans. Once the model is trained, the encoder can generate the compact hidden representation (the hidden feature vectors) of the training data set. Afterwards, we exploit the obtained hidden representation to build up the target probability density function (PDF) of the training data set by means of kernel density estimation (KDE). Subsequently, in the test phase, we feed a test CT into the trained encoder to produce the corresponding hidden feature vector, and then, we utilise the target PDF to compute the corresponding PDF value of the test image. Finally, this obtained value is compared to a threshold to assign the COVID-19 label or non-COVID-19 to the test image. We numerically check our approach’s performance (i.e. test accuracy and training times) by comparing it with those of some state-of-the-art methods.},

We apply this technique to visual band spacebased simulated imaging data from the Euclid Space Telescope using data from the strong gravitational lenses ﬁnding challenge. Our technique promisingly captures a variety of lensing features such as Einstein rings with different radii, distorted arc structures, etc., without using predeﬁned labels. After the clustering process, we obtain several classiﬁcation clusters separated by different visual features which are seen in the images. Our method successfully picks up ∼63 per cent of lensing images from all lenses in the training set. With the assumed probability proposed in this study, this technique reaches an accuracy of 77.25 ± 0.48 per cent in binary classiﬁcation using the training set. Additionally, our unsupervised clustering process can be used as the preliminary classiﬁcation for future surveys of lenses to efﬁciently select targets and to speed up the labelling process. As the starting point of the astronomical application using this technique, we not only explore the application to gravitationally lensed systems, but also discuss the limitations and potential future uses of this technique.},

As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical data bases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large data sets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence light curves from NASA’s Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence light curves. We use Kepler’s most notorious anomaly, Boyajian’s star (KIC 8462852), as a rare ‘ground truth’ for testing outlier identiﬁcation to verify that objects of genuine scientiﬁc interest are included among the identiﬁed anomalies. We evaluate the method’s ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behaviour in Boyajian’s star; we report the full list of identiﬁed anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identiﬁed outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler ﬁeld, and data artefacts. By identifying {\textless}4 per cent of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

	abstract = {The Galaxy Zoo team regularly receives requests for subject images for various versions of Galaxy Zoo, in order to facilitate other investigations, e.g. machine learning projects. This repository is an updated attempt to provide those in a way that is useful to the wider community. The images here are meant to be used with the data tables available at data.galaxyzoo.org. They are the "original" sample of subject images in Galaxy Zoo 2 (Willett et al. 2013, MNRAS, 435, 2835, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stt1458) as identified in Table 1 of Willett et al. and also in Hart et al. (2016, MNRAS, 461, 3663, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stw1588). The original GZ2 subjects also gave the option to view an inverted version of the subject image; these inverted images are not provided but are easily reproducible from the included subject images.  If you use this dataset, please cite Willett et al. (2013) as the general data release and also cite the DOI for this dataset; if you use the updated debiased tables from Hart et al. (2016) please cite that as well. There are 243,434 images in total. This is off by about 0.08\% from the total count in the tables - it's not clear what the cause of the discrepancy is, but we don't think the missing images have any particular sampling bias, so this sample should be useful for research. The images are available in a single zip file (images\_gz2.zip). The most recent and reliable source for morphology measurements is "GZ2 - Table 1 - Normal-depth sample with new debiasing method – CSV" (from Hart et al. 2016), which is available at data.galaxyzoo.org. To cross-reference the images with Table 1, this sample includes another CSV table (gz2\_filename\_mapping.csv) which contains three columns and 355,990 rows. The columns are: objid: the Data Release 7 (DR7) object ID for each galaxy. This should match the first column in Table 1. sample: string indicating the subsampling of the galaxy.   asset\_id: an integer that corresponds to the filename of the image in the zipped file linked above. As an example row: 587722981742084144,original,16 The galaxy is 587722981741363294, which is in Table 1 and was identified by GZ2 volunteers as a barred spiral galaxy with a mild bulge and two tightly-wound arms (morphology='Sc2t'). It is in the original GZ2 sample, and can be found in the zipped file as 16.jpg.  The overlap between the set of images, the attached table, and Table 1 is not 100\%; there are a few rows in the tables that don't have a corresponding image. Again, it's not clear what the exact reason is for this, but we suggest just dropping any missing rows/images from your analysis unless you have a need for analyzing specific subjects. If you do need a 100\% complete sample, you can obtain the missing images directly from SDSS.  Based on spot checks the mappings between asset ID and DR7 object ID appear correct, but we strongly suggest that you pick some random images and verify on your own that the image seems to match the label/classifications that are listed in Table 1.  If you have any issues using this dataset, please contact the Galaxy Zoo team, in particular Brooke Simmons (b.simmons@lancaster.ac.uk).

We ﬁnd objects which have extreme emission line ratios and abnormally strong absorption lines, objects with unusual continua, including extremely reddened galaxies. We ﬁnd galaxy-galaxy gravitational lenses, double-peaked emission line galaxies, and close galaxy pairs. We ﬁnd galaxies with high ionisation lines, galaxies which host supernovae, and galaxies with unusual gas kinematics. Only a fraction of the outliers we ﬁnd were reported by previous studies that used speciﬁc and tailored algorithms to ﬁnd a single class of unusual objects. Our algorithm is general and detects all of these classes, and many more, regardless of what makes them peculiar.

Distinct from previous unsupervised machine learning approaches used in astronomy we use no pre-selection or preﬁltering of target galaxy type to identify galaxies that are similar. We demonstrate the technique on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Fields. By training the algorithm using galaxies from one ﬁeld (Abell 2744) and applying the result to another (MACS 0416.1−2403), we show how the algorithm can cleanly separate early and late type galaxies without any form of pre-directed training for what an ‘early’ or ‘late’ type galaxy is. We then apply the technique to the HST CANDELS ﬁelds, creating a catalogue of approximately 60,000 classiﬁcations. We show how the automatic classiﬁcation groups galaxies of similar morphological (and photometric) type, and make the classiﬁcations public via a catalogue, a visual catalogue and galaxy similarity search. We compare the CANDELS machine-based classiﬁcations to human-classiﬁcations from the Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS project. Although there is not a direct mapping between Galaxy Zoo and our hierarchical labelling, we demonstrate a good level of concordance between human and machine classiﬁcations. Finally, we show how the technique can be used to identify rarer objects and present lensed galaxy candidates from the CANDELS imaging.},

	abstract = {Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, which is essential not only for the full spectrum of galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of science in observational cosmology (e.g. as a prior for photometric-redshift measurements and as contextual data for transient light-curve classiﬁcations). While a rich literature exists on morphologicalclassiﬁcation techniques, the unprecedented data volumes, coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming ‘Big-Data’ surveys (e.g. from the LSST), present novel challenges for this ﬁeld. Large data volumes make such data sets intractable for visual inspection (even via massively distributed platforms like Galaxy Zoo), while short cadences make it difﬁcult to employ techniques like supervised machine learning, since it may be impractical to repeatedly produce training sets on short time-scales. Unsupervised machine learning, which does not require training sets, is ideally suited to the morphological analysis of new and forthcoming surveys. Here, we employ an algorithm that performs clustering of graph representations, in order to group image patches with similar visual properties and objects constructed from those patches, like galaxies. We implement the algorithm on the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep survey, to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a small number (160) of ‘morphological clusters’, populated by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then benchmarked using visual inspection. The morphological classiﬁcations (which we release publicly) exhibit a high level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy properties as a function of morphological type at z {\textless} 1 (e.g. stellar-mass functions, rest-frame colours, and the position of galaxies on the star-formation main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning in performing accurate morphological analysis, which will become indispensable in this new era of deep-wide surveys.},

	abstract = {The large number of spectra obtained from sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the survey executed by the Large sky Area Multi-Object ﬁbre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST, also called GuoShouJing Telescope) provide us with opportunities to search for peculiar or even unknown types of spectra. In response to the limitations of existing methods, a novel outlier-mining method, the Monte Carlo Local Outlier Factor (MCLOF), is proposed in this paper, which can be used to highlight unusual and rare spectra from large spectroscopic survey data sets. The MCLOF method exposes outliers automatically and efﬁciently by marking each spectrum with a number, i.e. using outlier index as a ﬂag for an unusual and rare spectrum. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) represents how unusual and rare a spectrum is compared with other spectra and the Monte Carlo method is used to compute the global LOF for each spectrum by randomly selecting samples in each independent iteration. Our MCLOF method is applied to over half a million stellar spectra (classiﬁed as STAR by the SDSS Pipeline) from the SDSS data release 8 (DR8) and a total of 37 033 spectra are selected as outliers with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≥ 3 and outlier index ≥0.85. Some of these outliers are shown to be binary stars, emission-line stars, carbon stars and stars with unusual continuum. The results show that our proposed method can efﬁciently highlight these unusual spectra from the survey data sets. In addition, some relatively rare and interesting spectra are selected, indicating that the proposed method can also be used to mine rare, even unknown, spectra. The proposed method can be applicable not only to spectral survey data sets but also to other types of survey data sets. The spectra of all peculiar objects selected by our MCLOF method are available from a user-friendly website: http://sciwiki.lamost.org/Miningdr8/.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present the� rst distributed solution for the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method – a popular outlier detection technique shown to be very e�ective for datasets with skewed distributions. As datasets increase radically in size, highly scalable LOF algorithms leveraging modern distributed infrastructures are required. This poses signi�cant challenges due to the complexity of the LOF de�nition, and a lack of access to the entire dataset at any individual compute machine. Our solution features a distributed LOF pipeline framework, called DLOF. Each stage of the LOF computation is conducted in a fully distributed fashion by leveraging our invariant observation for intermediate value management. Furthermore, we propose a data assignment strategy which ensures that each machine is self-su�cient in all stages of the LOF pipeline, while minimizing the number of data replicas. Based on the convergence property derived from analyzing this strategy in the context of real world datasets, we introduce a number of data-driven optimization strategies. These strategies not only minimize the computation costs within each stage, but also eliminate unnecessary communication costs by aggressively pushing the LOF computation into the early stages of the DLOF pipeline. Our comprehensive experimental study using both real and synthetic datasets con�rms the e�ciency and scalability of our approach to terabyte level data.},

	abstract = {With the advent of future big-data surveys, automated tools for unsupervised discovery are becoming ever more necessary. In this work, we explore the ability of deep generative networks for detecting outliers in astronomical imaging data sets. The main advantage of such generative models is that they are able to learn complex representations directly from the pixel space. Therefore, these methods enable us to look for subtle morphological deviations which are typically missed by more traditional moment-based approaches. We use a generative model to learn a representation of expected data deﬁned by the training set and then look for deviations from the learned representation by looking for the best reconstruction of a given object. In this ﬁrst proof-of-concept work, we apply our method to two different test cases. We ﬁrst show that from a set of simulated galaxies, we are able to detect ∼90 per cent of merging galaxies if we train our network only with a sample of isolated ones. We then explore how the presented approach can be used to compare observations and hydrodynamic simulations by identifying observed galaxies not well represented in the models. The code used in this is available at https://github.com/carlamb/astronomical-outliers-WGAN.},

	abstract = {Wide-angle photometric surveys of previously uncharted sky areas or wavelength regimes will always bring in unexpected sources – novelties or even anomalies – whose existence and properties cannot be easily predicted from earlier observations. Such objects can be efﬁciently located with novelty detection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns among sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the whole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set of objects with spectroscopic identiﬁcations from the SDSS DR13 database, present also in AllWISE. The OCSVM method detects as anomalous those sources whose patterns – WISE photometric measurements in this case – are inconsistent with the model. Among the detected anomalies we ﬁnd artefacts, such as objects with spurious photometry due to blending, but more importantly also real sources of genuine astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identiﬁed a sample of heavily reddened AGN/quasar candidates distributed uniformly over the sky and in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN catalogues. It also allowed us to ﬁnd a speciﬁc group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and compact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with standard classiﬁcation methods it will be possible to improve the latter by accounting for sources which are not present in the training sample, but are otherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection adds ﬂexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the reliability and representativeness of the training samples. It should be thus considered as an essential step in supervised classiﬁcation schemes to ensure completeness and purity of produced catalogues.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

	abstract = {In present study, we proposed a general framework based on a convolutional kernel and a variational autoencoder (CVAE) for anomaly detection on both complex image and vector datasets. The main idea is to maximize mutual information (MMI) through regularizing key information as follows: (1) the features between original input and the representation of latent space, (2) that between the ﬁrst convolutional layer output and the last convolutional layer input, (3) original input and output of the decoder to train the model. Therefore, the proposed CVAE is optimized by combining the representations learned across the three different objectives targeted at MMI on both local and global variables with the original training objective function of Kullback–Leibler divergence distributions. It allowed achieving the additional supervision power for the detection of image and vector data anomalies using convolutional and fully connected layers, respectively. Our proposal CVAE combined by regularizing multiple discriminator spaces to detect anomalies was introduced for the ﬁrst time as far as we know. To evaluate the reliability of the proposed CVAE-MMI, it was compared with the convolutional autoencoder-based model using the original objective function. Furthermore, the performance of our network was compared over state-of-the-art approaches in distinguishing anomalies concerning both image and vector datasets. The proposed structure outperformed the state-of-the-arts with high and stable area under the curve values.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10489-020-01944-5},
	abstract = {This study focused on the problem of anomaly detection (AD) by means of mixture-of-experts network. Most of the existing AD methods solely based on the reconstruction errors or latent representation using a single low-dimensional manifold are often not ideal for the image objects with complex background. However, modeling the data as a mixture of low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds is natural and promising for the classification of anomalies. In this study to realize the promise of multi-manifold latent information for AD, we propose a mixture of experts ensemble with two convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) and convolution network (MEx-CVAEC) which explicitly learns manifold relationships of data that make use of multiple encoded detections. Additionally, we integrate a linear-based CAE as a gating network which optimizes the expert structures for efficient data characterization based on the manifold of the latent space. In the expert structure the data is re-encoded after each decoder to enhance the latent detection performance and the VAE is used as a core element in the encoder-decoder-encode (EDE) pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting a mixture of CVAEs-based models for AD. The performance of the MEx-CVAE with EDE pipeline which we names as (MEx-CVAEC) compared over two basic MEx-CVAE model with ED pipeline based on logistic regression (MEx-L) and based on CAE (MEx-C) structures. In addition, the performance of the proposed model on three different datasets show the highest average AUC value than that of the state-of-the-art for image anomalies detection task.},

	abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

For detecting unusual spectra, we use eight-layer deep convolutional network with autoencoder architecture on ∼ 60,000 spectra collected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The training of the network is done in an unsupervised manner. We show that the trained network is able to retrieve the spectra of rare objects from a large collection of spectra.
